# Web Development Project 4 - *Veni Vici!*

Submitted by: **Muhib Sheikh**

This web app: **Veni Vici is a web app that displays information about a random cat using a Cat API**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

The main challenges I faced while building this app where getting the API to work correct/get the results I wanted, getting the data I wanted from the API response, making the ban list,
making the website look similar to the example/the CSS in general, and making sure the API key was secret (I found a nice article while helped luckily).
